            Identify the most critical as well as the none critical pain points based on user feedback for a given SaaS product and propose 1â€“2 highly targeted micro-SaaS solutions that directly address these issues. The proposed solutions may either:
            - Supplement the existing SaaS as a plugin, extension, or add-on that enhances its functionality, or
            - Compete as an independent tool, solving the identified issues in a superior way and potentially capturing market share.

            The AI should extract insights from user feedback across relevant platforms (e.g., ProductHunt, G2, Trustpilot, Reddit, Twitter, official forums) by examining the provided SaaS product (via its Name, URL, and Description, if available) to determine its pain points and recommend actionable micro-SaaS opportunities.

            Please ensure the final output is a valid JSON object with separate keys for each category, and that each array contains individual JSON objects (do not include inline comments in the output).

    - Solutions should have clear differentiation from existing offerings
    - Include specific evidence and examples where possible
    - Focus on actionable opportunities with clear market demand
    - Consider both technical feasibility and business viability
